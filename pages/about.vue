        <p>How do we translate performance from the stage to the screen?</p>
        <p>
          Frustrated by the limitations of performances placed on platforms such
          as YouTube or Zoom, together artists Heidi Latsky and Maya Man decided
          that rather than translating from stage to screen, they would instead
          create a dance experience that, from the beginning, was choreographed
          to be viewed on a computer screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is <span class="italic">Recessed</span>, a dance-driven,
          interactive performance staged in the Internet browser, the space
          through which most of our interactions occurred over the past year.
          Clicking on a dancer featured on the project website’s main page
          reveals an arrangement of pop up windows. While the dancer’s photos
          are pulled from past live performances, the video clips triggered by
          this interaction showcase each dancer moving in private while in their
          own home or neighborhood. Viewers navigate through the work at their
          own pace and in their own chosen order. With over fifteen unique pop
          up window experiences to discover (at least three per dancer), the
          piece is never exactly the same twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="italic">Recessed</span> runs on custom software developed
          by Maya Man. The software gives the artists full choreographic control
          over various aspects of the pop up windows including their size,
          location, transitions, and timing. Throughout their collaboration, Man
          and Latsky often watched footage sent over by the dancer over a video
          call and discussed how specific sections of a clip might be staged.
          Together, they worked to develop a distinct point of view on each
          dancer. In many ways, the production process involved qualities
          required for both choreographing a performance and editing a video
          piece. As the artists co-choreographed, they continually tinkered with
          timing, transitions, and placement in order to maximize the emotional
          power of each performer.

          The project currently features dancers Sabrina Bennette, Desmond
          Cadogan, Jillian Hollis, Donald Lee, Sora Sol who represent a range of
          movement backgrounds and abilities.
