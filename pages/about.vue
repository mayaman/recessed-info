          The dancers, agentically choosing the time and location of their
          recording sessions, composed moments to consider privacy, solitude,
          and secrecy. Instead of being on display in front of the camera, the
          dancers are performing for and with themselves.The kaleidoscopic
          placement of the pop-up windows, however, insists on the viewer’s
          access to the entirety of their screens, exploring simultaneously the
          intensely singular and plural aspects of the dancers’ performances.

          Artists Sabrina Bennette, Desmond Cadogan, Meredith Fages, Jillian
          Hollis, Donald Lee, Claude-Andrée Louissaint, and Sora Sol recorded
          dances for the camera. The resultantly mediated bodies are distributed
          across a desktop screen in carefully choreographed patterns, a formal
          variating designed collaboratively by Man and Latsky.

          The dancer’s photos are culled from past live performances, but the
          video clips triggered by interaction showcase each dancer moving in
          private while in their own home or neighborhood. Viewers navigate the
          work at their own pace, and in their own chosen order. With over
          fifteen unique pop up window experiences to discover (and at least
          three per dancer), the piece is never exactly the same twice.

          Recessed runs on custom software developed by Man, which gave the
          artists full choreographic control over various aspects of the pop up
          windows including their size, location, transitions, and timing.
          Throughout their collaboration, Man and Latsky considered footage sent
          over by the dancer and discussed how specific sections of a clip might
          be staged. Together, they worked to develop a distinct point of view
          for each dancer. The production process involved both choreographic
          and video-editing techniques, with both Man and Latsky enacting
          creative decisions pertaining to timing, transitions, and placement so
          as to maximize the emotional power of each performer.

          Recessed is in conversation with other artists’ work in the genres of
          Post-Internet Art, Movement and Computation, and Desktop Cinema. It
          seeks to re-mix and re-kindle browser-based explorations of the early
          2000s (for example, the web marketing campaign for the 2000 film
          Requiem for a Dream) with an emphasis on contemporary considerations
          of embodiment, ability, intersectionality and performance.
